### Day 6: Sunday, December 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Studied working with conditionals in javascript. Working with if...else statements and logical operators.

### Day 7: Monday, December 4th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked with more conditional operators today, basically learnt the ropes around using ternary operator, truthy & falsy, switch statements and the positives of falling through.

### Day 9: Wednesday, December 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed Lesson 13: Loops on the #ALCwithGoogle course hosted by udacity. Worked with for loops, nested for loops as well as checked out how increments and decrements can be made with less hassle.

**Thoughts**: It takes patience and stern observance to work with JS, or basically any programming language.
