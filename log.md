### Day 16: Thursday, December 21st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: So my internet connection was kinda wack today so couldn't get on udacity. Then I remebered freeCodeCamp. First started from where I left off at the JS track but later went on to basic algotrithms to try out all I've learnt so far and twas fun.

**Thoughts**: Yeah, I know I've not been relly consistent with my days but I'll try to see how that can change, been really busy lately.

Also learnt how to amend commits, unstage files and undo changes to files on the working directory.

**Thoughts**: I really need to device a major method to remain consistent with this, plus well I think the christmas period had it's part to play this time.
