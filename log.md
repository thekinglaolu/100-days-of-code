# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sunday, November 26th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Nothing was done due to light issues and stuff. I know this is only a sign of better days to come.


### Day 1: Monday, November 27th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I went through Lesson 5: CSS Syntax on the #ALCwithGoogle Udacity course.

**Thoughts** It was basically a refresher on things I previously knew, such as; the css ruleset, comments in css, attribute, selectors, css units and developer tools.

**Today's Progress**: Today I went through Lesson 7: How to code faster on the #ALCwithGoogle Udacity course andd completed my animal card project.
